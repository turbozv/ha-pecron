# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Battery pack sensors**: Exposes battery voltage in volts, signed battery current in amperes, calculated battery power in watts, and battery temperature in degrees Celsius when supported by the device TSL. Battery power is positive while charging and negative while discharging.

### Fixed
- Read battery voltage, current, and temperature from the nested battery packet exposed by the Pecron API and discover all three sensors through its `host_packet_data_jdb` TSL property.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-10

### Changed
- **Dynamic AC Charge Speed options from TSL specs**: Options are now derived from each device model's TSL metadata instead of being hardcoded. E300LFP shows 0%/25%/50%/75%/100% (values 0-4), E3600LFP shows 10%/20%/.../100% (values 1-10), and other models will automatically get their correct options.
- Upgraded to unofficial-pecron-api v0.4.0 (adds `TslProperty.enum_values` and `enum_map` for ENUM properties)
- Graceful fallback to E300LFP defaults if TSL specs are unavailable

### Fixed
- AC Charge Speed select showing wrong options for E3600LFP and other non-E300LFP models (#5)

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **AC Input Power sensor** - Grid/AC charging power (W), extracted from `ac_data_input_hm` struct
- **DC Input Power sensor** - Solar/DC input power (W), extracted from `dc_data_input_hm` struct
- Both sensors use TSL-based discovery and only appear for devices that report these properties

### Changed
- Sensor descriptor supports struct field extraction for STRUCT-type TSL properties
- TSL filtering now handles `_data_input_hm` code variants for struct sensors

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **AC Charge Speed Control**: New select entity to control AC charging power level
  - Options: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%
  - Optimistic UI updates with 20-second settling period
  - Delayed refreshes at 5s and 15s for state reconciliation
  - TSL-based discovery: only created for devices that support `ac_charging_power_ios`
- **New select platform**: Framework for future dropdown-style controls

### Changed
- Upgraded to unofficial-pecron-api v0.3.0 (adds `set_ac_charge_speed()` and expanded device properties)

## [0.3.5] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- **Eliminated UI flicker during switch toggles**
  - Problem: Switches showed ON → OFF → ON pattern when toggling
  - Root cause: Immediate coordinator refresh returned stale state, clearing optimistic update
  - Solution: 20-second settling period keeps optimistic state while device processes change
  - Stale coordinator updates ignored during settling period
  - UI now shows smooth ON/OFF transitions without flickering back to old state
- Switch state synchronization now rock-solid with optimistic updates + settling period + delayed refreshes

## [0.3.4] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- **Enhanced switch state synchronization** with delayed refreshes
  - Added automatic refreshes at 5 seconds and 15 seconds after toggle
  - Accounts for device processing delay
  - Ensures UI eventually syncs even if optimistic update doesn't trigger
  - Multiple refresh attempts catch slow device responses
- Combines optimistic updates (instant feedback) with scheduled polling (guaranteed sync)

## [0.3.3] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Switch state not updating in UI after toggle
  - Implemented optimistic UI updates for instant feedback
  - UI now updates immediately when toggling AC/DC switches
  - State reverts automatically if API call fails
  - Background coordinator refresh confirms actual device state
- Previous behavior: UI showed stale state until next scheduled refresh (up to 10 minutes)
- New behavior: UI updates instantly, confirmed by API within seconds

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Smart Time Sensor Logic**: Time to Full and Time to Empty sensors now intelligently show N/A based on device state
  - **IDLE** (no power flow): Both sensors show N/A
  - **CHARGING** (input > 0, no output): Show Time to Full, N/A for Time to Empty
  - **DISCHARGING** (output > 0, no input): N/A for Time to Full, show Time to Empty
  - **UPS MODE** (both input and output): Show both values (charging time + runtime if input lost)
- **Always Show Both Sensors**: Both time sensors always appear regardless of TSL availability
- **Robust Edge Case Handling**:
  - Missing properties: Pass through N/A
  - Zero values: Show 0 (indicates battery full/empty, not N/A)
  - Negative power values: Treated as 0 (measurement errors)
  - None/missing power values: Treated as 0

### Changed
- Time sensors bypass TSL filtering (always created)
- Time sensor values are now context-aware instead of raw API values

### Developer
- Added 18 comprehensive unit tests for time sensor logic
- All device states tested (idle, charging, discharging, UPS mode)
- Edge cases: missing properties, zero values, negative/None power values
- Total test count: 43 (all passing)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- **Critical**: TSL filtering was too strict, causing switches and some sensors to not appear after integration reload
- TSL property codes use `_hm` suffix (e.g., `ac_switch_hm`) but API maps them to properties without suffix (e.g., `ac_switch`)
- Filtering logic now checks both `property_name` and `property_name_hm` variants
- Switches (AC Output, DC Output) now appear correctly
- UPS Mode binary sensor now appears correctly
- All supported entities are now created properly

### Impact
If you upgraded to v0.3.0 and don't see your switches:
1. Update to v0.3.1
2. Reload the integration (Settings → Devices & Services → Pecron → three dots → Reload)
3. Switches and missing sensors will now appear

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Controllable Switch Entities**: AC and DC outputs are now controllable switches (previously read-only binary sensors)
  - Turn AC/DC outputs on/off directly from Home Assistant
  - Create automations to control power outputs based on conditions
  - Enhanced error handling with persistent notifications on control failure
- **Advanced Control Service**: New `pecron.set_property` service for power users
  - Control any writable device property via automations or scripts
  - TSL validation ensures only valid properties are modified
  - Auto-converts value types (boolean strings, numbers)
  - Detailed error feedback for troubleshooting
- **TSL-Based Dynamic Discovery**: Integration now queries device capabilities
  - Only creates entities for properties the device actually supports
  - No more 'unavailable' entities for unsupported features
  - Automatically supports new device models without code changes
  - Logs discovered readable and writable properties for diagnostics

### Changed
- Upgraded to unofficial-pecron-api v0.2.0 (adds control capabilities)
- AC and DC outputs moved from binary_sensor platform to switch platform
- Binary sensors now only include UPS Mode and Online status (read-only properties)

### Fixed
- Token refresh now triggers correctly during property fetch failures (not just initial device fetch)
- Authentication errors during `get_device_properties()` now properly reset API and retry
- Case-insensitive detection of authentication errors (5032, token, 401, unauthorized, authentication)

### Developer
- Added comprehensive test suite for token refresh scenarios (16 tests, all passing)
- Improved test coverage for coordinator retry logic
- Enhanced logging for token refresh operations

## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- Fixed AttributeError in options flow when accessing integration options
- Removed unnecessary `__init__` override in `PecronOptionsFlow` that was trying to set read-only `config_entry` property

### Added
- Dynamic device discovery - new devices automatically detected without HA restart
- Configurable refresh interval (1-60 minutes, default: 10 minutes)
- Options flow to change refresh interval after initial setup
- Comprehensive logging for device discovery and data fetching
- Property name validation and debugging
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for initial data fetch
- Persistent notifications for connection issues and missing devices
- Better error differentiation (auth vs connection vs data errors)

### Fixed
- Critical bug where empty dict check prevented entity creation
- Entity descriptions now properly inherit from Home Assistant base classes
- Property validation warnings for missing attributes

### Changed
- Default refresh interval increased from 5 to 10 minutes (reduces API load)
- Integration automatically reloads when refresh interval is changed

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added
